# Outsourcing general notes
Each project data physically exists on studio network drive.  
To outsource any part of work we create FTP server with project copy on it with the same folder structure. Outsource company should replicate studio folder structure on their own network drive and copy all necessary data to a corresponding location.  
Software also should be matched to studio software exactly.  
Such setup will ensure, that everything will work properly.
